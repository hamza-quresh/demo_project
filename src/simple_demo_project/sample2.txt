Climate Change: Causes and Effects

Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate change is natural, human activities have been the main driver since the mid-20th century.

Causes of Climate Change:
1. Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) for energy
2. Deforestation and land use changes
3. Industrial processes and manufacturing
4. Agricultural practices
5. Waste management

Effects of Climate Change:
- Rising global temperatures
- More frequent and severe weather events
- Sea level rise
- Ocean acidification
- Loss of biodiversity
- Food and water security issues

Solutions and Mitigation:
- Transition to renewable energy sources
- Energy efficiency improvements
- Sustainable transportation
- Reforestation and conservation
- Carbon capture technologies
- International cooperation and policy changes

The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. Individual actions, combined with systemic changes, are necessary to address this global challenge.
